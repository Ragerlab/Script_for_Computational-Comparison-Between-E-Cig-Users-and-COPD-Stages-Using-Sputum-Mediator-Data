# Script for "Similarity of Sputum Mediator Signatures Between E-Cigarette Users and COPD Depends on GOLD Stage and Type of E-Cigarette: A Pilot Study"

Script author: Elise Hickman (ehickman@email.unc.edu)

This study set out to compare induced sputum soluble mediator profiles between e-cigarette users and participants with different stages of COPD using a suite of computational approaches (manuscript currently in submission). 

**1_SummaryTables_VariablebyVariable:** Analysis specific to between COPD stages only, including creation of summary tables and variable by variable analyses across the COPD stages. 

**2_COPD_ECig_Integration:** Integration of e-cigarette user data into the dataset, including batch correction, and analysis of similarities and differences between e-cigarette users and participants with COPD via correlation networks, hierarchical clustering, and Mahalanobis distance.
